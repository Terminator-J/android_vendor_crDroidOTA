crDroid 9.0

Changelog for initial Android 13 release (notable changes moving forward from Android 12 device trees/kernel):
- Merged November ASB & changes from upstream LineageOS device/kernel/vendor trees.
- It's a new major Android version; if you want to see changes since previous testing builds, join the Telegram group.
- Kernel updated to 4.9.333 with updates merged from Google's AOSP 4.9 LTS repository (thanks to BananaFunction).
- Updated my stack of kernel commits, including refreshed wifi & power commits and numerous other tweaks from MCD kernel r19 (thanks, Danny! <3).
- Kernel adreno driver should no longer aggressively try to downclock GPU below 40% battery (causing everything to be sluggish regardless of CPU settings).
- NFC stack is now built from source, and some security authentication apps might struggle running under Android 13. NFC itself seems to be working fine & Google Wallet for contactless payment seems to be working fine.
- I would've gotten this release out a month ago except it took that long to figure out how to get OnePlus Camera & Gallery back to 100% working again (huge thanks to Weritos & jabashque).
- Dropped "Multiple intensities" vibration option from Accessibility/haptics, since it never actually worked correctly. Use DeviceExtras for controlling vibration strength.
- Look, DASH charging & Smart Charging and a bunch of other things took way more work to figure out how to get them to behave (nearly) the same as they did before than they should have.Takes time to make it appear like a simple, easy update.

Known issues:
- Users upgrading from 8.x should plan on doing a clean flash, and again, MindTheGapps is the recommended Google Apps package. If you don't, you might have issues with NFC, OnePlus Camera/Gallery, itchiness, frequent/painful urination, and in very few cases spontaneous human combustion. Safety not guaranteed.
- Smart charging doesn't always stop exactly at the specified percentage when using a DASH charger or when device is in deep sleep. That's as smart as it gets for initial Android 13 release.
- "Haptic feedback on Back gesture" feature doesn't actually work yet. Needs investigation after we worry about updating to December ASB sources.
- Haptic feedback for tri-state-key disappears when you turn off "touch feedback" haptics now, when it wasn't like that before. Android 13, amirite?
- Custom fonts don't apply properly to 3rd party apps. It's in the crDroid GitHub issue tracker already.
- You tell me, with logs!

Installation notes:
- Plan on doing a clean flash when changing major Android system versions (so if you're coming from crDroid 8, and want to give me a bug report, because I'll ignore you otherwise). Back up your data first of course. After this initial clean flash for Android 13, it should be fine to just use the built-in Updater in Settings > System > Updates for future updates.
- If you're coming from stock or another ROM, reboot to bootloader and fastboot flash the boot.img for your device (enchilada or fajita) to both boot slots, then reboot to bootloader again *so it actually loads the new recovery ramdisk*.
- YOU SHOULD INSTALL FROM CRDROID RECOVERY, since we can't do a clean flash from built-in updater, and we DON'T want to run addon.d scripts because you need to update to a newer GApps package. So follow the regular adb sideloading process from recovery (reboot recovery, format data if doing clean install, adb sideload ROM zip, reboot recovery to trigger slot switch, adb sideload GApps/microG/magisk/whatever, reboot system).
- See XDA thread for troubleshooting installation issues, or other common issues including problems with OxygenOS Camera & Gallery.
