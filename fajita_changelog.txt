crDroid 10.5-r2

Before we get into the rest of it, here's the big thing to know (for those still on 10.4 or earlier):

*** "SIGNED" BUILDS ***
- Attempting to update from 10.4 or earlier from the system OTA updater (Settings > System > System Updates) will fail with a "verification failed" error.
- You have to download the ROM zip to a computer or USB OTG drive and install the update via recovery.
  - No factory reset required; this will not erase your data.
  - Since you're flashing in recovery (which does not preserve GApps), you DO need to reboot to recovery when prompted, and flash your Google Apps or microG or crDroid++ kernel or any other addon zip to the freshly-updated slot BEFORE booting to system.
  - After you've updated to a "release-keys" signed build (10.5 or newer) by flashing in recovery once, all future OTA updates will once again work as normal from the booted Updater in Settings > System > System Updates.
- Previous releases were made using "test-keys" (cryptographic signature of the ROM installation payload).
  - Google checks for that now as part of Play Integrity, and will fail devices using "test-keys" for their builds.
  - The crDroid dev team made organization-wide signing keys ("release-keys") that all of us maintainers are now using when compiling the ROM.

Changes since v10.5 (17 June) release:
- Still May 2024 Android Security Bulletin (android-14.0.0_r35) -- unchanged.
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - Updated device spoofing fingerprint for PixelPropsUtils for Play Integrity shenanigans.
- Device-specific things I can't stop screwing around with:
  - No really, background apps really ought to stop getting killed immediately again.
  - Minor adjustment to power/perf (increase uprate limit on Big CPU cores so it should treat higher frequencies as less desirable; still single value at boot time rather than adjusted during runtime, so you should be able to override via kernel manager if rooted without libperfmgr stomping on your settings).
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Release Notes:
- Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. But I'm gonna be busy a lot, and the device might get dropped again through the summer & fall because I can only get around to finishing a testing/fixing/release cycle every other month during this busy time of year.
- TL;DR make sure you do the following setup steps or don't bother submitting bug reports:
  - Settings > Display > turn OFF "Prevent accidental wake-up" (use the Pocket Mode in crDroid Settings > Misc instead).
  - Settings > System > Gestures > turn OFF "Lift to check phone" (use crDroid Settings > User Interface > Ambient Display settings instead).
  - Settings > Apps > Default Apps > tap the Gear (settings) icon next to crDroid Home (the default launcher) to open "Home settings" > Recents > turn OFF the "Shake phone to clear all tasks" toggle switch (it causes terrible SystemUI slowdowns & crashes after a couple hours).
  - Go to https://gitlab.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_oneplus_apps/-/tree/14.0/sdm845/vendor/priv-app?ref_type=heads and download the APKs for OnePlusCamera and OnePlusGallery, then install them (it will ask you if you want to update the existing apps; choose yes each time).
  - [Optional] Go get this thing https://mega.nz/file/UHpDQS4L#FGKPas4_OM2Z5b5iE1R0zNZKUEa069uPJ7NAiluViXI and put it into Internal Storage > Android > obb > com.oneplus.gallery since it doesn't download correctly in-app due to sepolicy things I can't be bothered with in Android 14 (or don't if you don't care about OP Gallery being able to do image classification).

Known issues:
- Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS).
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - Background blurring requires significant boosts to render smoothly. You should consider turning off the "window-level blurs" toggle in Settings > Display if you want to make things smoother & save battery. Or turn up AdrenoBoost in Settings > DeviceExtras for MOAR SMOOTH.
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PASS FOR GOOGLE PAY/WALLET EVENTUALLY. Google has been on a rampage against custom ROMs and unlocked bootloaders being able to spoof Play Integrity in a meaningful way, and seems to be requiring hardware-backed integrity (which is currently not spoofable) for Pay/Wallet. It has always been a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time. Currently a new install will show up with "Device Certified" in Play Store, but that might change any time and is not considered a bug. The ROM devs update the spoofed fingerprint, and it takes me forever to get updates releases pushed, and then it's out of date by the time you get it. Sorry. Hate Google, not me. Change to a better bank & use the website instead of a crappy "app", and complain loudly while you threaten to take your money somewhere else that doesn't make broken apps.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile.
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - Go do the setup things in the Release Notes section; really. Or else I will ignore your bug reports. So there.
